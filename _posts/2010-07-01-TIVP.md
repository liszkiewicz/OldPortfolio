*This is Visual Poetry* (2010) contains sixteen visual poems created and controlled through computer game glitches. I used an NES emulator as an instrument, improvised and composed in real time, and recorded the output of my play. *This is Visual Poetry* was published by Dan Waber in July 2010, as the 51st chapbook in his This is Visual Poetry series, and also appears as a chapter in my full-length collection, [AFEELD](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitaloriginals/afeeld/output/this-is-visual-poetry/).
