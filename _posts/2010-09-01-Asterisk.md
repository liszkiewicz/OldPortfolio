*Asterisk* (2010) is a concrete game that remixes the "top-down shooter" genre of video games. The user controls an asterisk that zooms around atop a canvas, dodging and shooting various colored opponents. Avatar and enemies alike leave trails marking their paths, and these trails accumulate as play progresses. When the asterisk-avatar shoots an opponent, the opponent bursts with a splat of color. *Asterisk* is thus both a game and an instrument for playful painting.

The project has been published at *Certain Circuits*, and exhibited at the Ellen Powell Tiberno Museum in Philadelphia, PA. Production was supported in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, through a grant made by the Humanities Gaming Institute at the University of South Carolina.
