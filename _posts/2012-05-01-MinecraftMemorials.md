*Minecraft Memorials* (2011-12) is a virtual artistic intervention, in which the members of RUST LTD. install memorials to real-life coal mining accidents on multiplayer Minecraft servers. We have installed memorials to the [Sago Coal Mine Disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster) on the [Toy Studio](http://www.toystudio.com/) server, the CTCS 505 server at the University of Southern California, and other public Minecraft servers. The project was presented as part of a talk, "Minecraft Memorials: Deconstructing Virtual Worlds Through Artistic Interventions", at the UC Irvine Visual Studies Conference in 2012.
