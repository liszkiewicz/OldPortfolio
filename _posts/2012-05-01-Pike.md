*The Lt. John Pike Memeorial Browser Extension* (2012) is an artistic intervention generated by a browser extension. If the extension is installed and activated, the user’s web browsing experience will occasionally be interrupted by Lt. John Pike, who will walk into the user’s browser window, shake his bottle of military-grade pepper spray, and temporarily blind the user (i.e. black out their current webpage). In this way, the Pike Memeorial transforms the user’s browser into a memorial site for both the [2011 UC Davis Pepper Spray Incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Davis_pepper-spray_incident) and the subsequent [Casually Pepper Spray Everything Cop meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/casually-pepper-spray-everything-cop).

The Pike Memeorial has been presented at universities like NYU and CalArts, and was exhibited at [Memefest 2014](http://www.memefest.org/), where it received an [Award for Socially Responsive Communication/Design/Art](http://www.memefest.org/en/gallery/works2014/) in the Visual Communication Practice: Web/Interactive Category.
