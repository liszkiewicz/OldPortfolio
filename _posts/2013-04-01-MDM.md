*Mark Ditto Mark* (2013) is a conceptual novel generated by a browser extension. When installed and activated, the extension will alter any names of people which appear on the currently displayed Internet page: first names are changed to “Mark,” and last names are changed to “Ditto.” In this way, Mark Ditto Mark transforms the Internet into a gigantic, sprawling novel about someone named “Mark Ditto.”

Mark Ditto Mark was published in the ["Beyond Category" issue](http://www.hws.edu/senecareview/bc/art6.aspx) of Seneca Review, and was [featured on Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-browser-extension-that-turns-the-internet-into-a-terrify#.jeaJxRekr).
