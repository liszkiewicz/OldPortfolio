*Andy June* (2010-12) is a heteronym under which I produced soundwork, ytmnd sites, and amateurish conceptual art. The name began with a spoof of Miranda July, and accidentally became an ongoing project. Andy edited the short-lived sound journal *Cassette*, and published work in [Cricket Online Review](http://www.cricketonlinereview.com/vol7no2/37-andy-june-unut.php "Cricket Online Review"), [As Long as it Takes](http://www.aslongasittakes.org/issue5.html), and [Textsound](http://www.textsound.org/index.php?ISSUE=11). He may have released an album, but I can neither confirm nor deny this.

You can find Andy through [email](mailto:tsivist@googlemail.com) and on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/tsivist) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tsivist).
