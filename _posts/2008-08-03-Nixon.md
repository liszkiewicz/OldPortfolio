*Nixonâ€™s Confession* (2008) is an interactive audio installation that uses one of the Watergate recordings to create a virtual, critical experience for the listener. It has been installed at the University at Buffalo's Center for the Arts, the 2008 Buffalo Infringement Festival, and elsewhere.

You can listen to the project's audio [here](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/secret-white-house-tapes).
