*80:00* (2013) is a strategy game about getting away with murder at a cocktail party, and an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film *Rope*. For eighty tense minutes, the player must manage the guestsâ€™ attention, keep their accomplice calm, and maintain focus to ensure no one learns the truth. *80:00* (i.e. "Eighty Minutes") has been exhibited at the 2013 Computers and Writing Conference, the "Strange Tales" exhibition at Clemson University, and at "Repercussions: A Serious Games and Immersive Journalism Exhibition" at the University of Southern California. It was released by [RUST LTD.](http://rustltd.com/) in 2013. I was a designer and writer on the project.
