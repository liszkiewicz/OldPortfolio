*Every Server at the Internet Archive in San Francisco, CA* (2013) is a digital artists' book created in collaboration with Heidi Sulzdorf-Liszkiewicz. Inspired by [the work of Ed Ruscha](http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/worksofart/every-building-on-the-sunset-strip/), we photographed every server at the San Francisco headquarters of the Internet Archive, as part of an artists' residency jointly sponsored by the Internet Archive and Tumblr. The photographs can be viewed online at [the project website](http://everyserver.tumblr.com/).
