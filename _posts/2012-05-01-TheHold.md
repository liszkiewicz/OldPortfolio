*The Hold* (2012) is a first-person 3D puzzle platformer that takes place inside of a massive MC Escher-like ship. Users must navigate the absurd space, solve puzzles, shift gravity, and maintain perspective as they try to escape. The demo has been shown at the [UCLA Game Art Festival](http://festival.games.ucla.edu/) at the Hammer Museum, [TEDxUSC](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/3558) at the University of Southern California, [First Look 2012](http://cinema.usc.edu/festivals/firstlook/) at the Directors' Guild of America, and [Game Fest 2012](http://www.hass.rpi.edu/pl/gamefest-2012-symposium-exhibition) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where it won the People's Choice Award for "Best in Show". The demo can be downloaded from the ["Featured Projects" section](https://alloy.rustltd.com/showcase/hold) of RUST LTD.'s Alloy product website. I was the project lead and co-creative director for the game.
