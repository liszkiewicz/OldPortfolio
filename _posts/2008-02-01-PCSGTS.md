Power Crazy Senior General Than Shwe (2008) is an anthology of poems written in support of jailed Burmese poet [Saw Wai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_Wai). Two days after his jailing, I blogged a protest poem, “Emperor Ink,” and began soliciting poets for the anthology. The completed anthology was published at *Anti-* on 09 February 2008, only eighteen days after Saw Wai was jailed for writing his poem, “February 14,” in protest of Burmese autocrat Than Shwe.

Saw Wai spent almost two years in prison for writing his poem. He was released on 26 May 2010.
