*inCharacter* (2012) is an augmented card game created for the Independent Television Service (ITVS) and their Women and Girls Lead public media campaign. It was designed to facilitate discussion around the issues presented in over fifty documentaries included in the campaign. Players draw question cards, place a character card at the center of the table, and then answer those questions from the perspective of the woman on the character card (who was a subject of one of the documentaries). Then, players discuss their answers, and the group chooses the best answer and awards the character card to the person who provided that answer. The first person with three character cards wins the game. Players could also scan the character card using the game's mobile app, to learn more information about the woman depicted there. (More information can be learned through [this "How to Play" video](https://vimeo.com/52526704) and [this essay on *MediaCommons*](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/question/where-do-you-see-digital-divide-your-work-andor-scholarship/response/designing-social-jus-1).)

*inCharacter* (a.k.a. *A Question of Character*) was played at various ITVS Community Cinema Events, including ["Half The Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide"](https://vimeo.com/50018377) at the Chicago Cultural Center in Sept. 2012. It was also exhibited at the [2012 Neta Conference](http://www.netaonline.org/1012/Sess-Details.htm#Women_and_Girls), and was [played](https://vimeo.com/131578865) and presented at ["Feminist Infrastructures and Technocultures: Cross-Disciplinary Legacies and Futures"](http://feministit.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego in April 2013. In partnership with Take Action Games, I served as co-designer and digital prototyper of the game.
