*Count As One* (2009) is a chapbook of fifteen interactive poems inspired by the work of Alain Badiou and the tradition of modernist concrete poetry. Users can click inside each poem to reveal and author meaning, and can also print, save, and publish their own unique output. The chapbook appears in the Fall 2009 issue of *New River: a Journal of Digital Writing and Art*, and as a chapter in my full-length collection, [*AFEELD*](http://afeeld.com).

You can view the original chapbook at [New River Journal](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/journals/newriver/09Fall/liszkiewicz/count/index.html), if you have flash installed. Otherwise, you can view it as [part of *AFEELD*](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitaloriginals/afeeld/countasone/circuits/).
