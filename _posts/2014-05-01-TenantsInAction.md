*Tenants in Action* (2012-13) is a mobile app designed to facilitate communication between low-income tenants and governmental agencies in South Los Angeles. Users can access Tenants in Action (TIA) in English or Spanish through their smartphones, enter information about a problem or complaint, and send that information directly to local government agencies. In turn, TIA converts that information into the same format currently used by those agencies' existing website-based complaint forms, requiring neither changes to the agencies' websites nor access to those agencies' secure data. The TIA mobile app framework was developed using JQuery Mobile and other open-source technologies, in collaboration with [Strategic Actions for a Just Economy](http://www.saje.net) (SAJE) and USC's Institute for Multimedia Literacy (IML).

[Tenants in Action](http://calltia.com/) has been featured in the [International Journal of Learning and Media](http://civictripod.com/civictripod.com/games/tenants-in-action/index.html) and [In Media Res](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/question/where-do-you-see-digital-divide-your-work-andor-scholarship/response/designing-social-jus-0), and has been presented at the [Participation / Exploitation Conference](http://recursivepublic.net/participation-exploitation/) at UCLA and the [Transcriptions Research Slam](http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/cfp-mediating-the-nonhuman-conference-and-the-6th-annual-ucsb-research-slam/) at UC Santa Barbara.
