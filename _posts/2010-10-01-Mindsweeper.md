*M!ndsweeper* (2010) is a re-imagining of the classic game Minesweeper as a neo-dadaist concrete poem. The informational numbers have been replaced with groups of consonants, and those consonants change after each round of play. To play the game is to engage in a kind of purposeful forgetting in the tense space between competing acts of signification.

[M!ndsweeper](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitaloriginals/afeeld/concretegames/mndsweeper/) was published in Issue 27 of [Oxford Magazine](https://issuu.com/oxmag/docs/oxmag_winter_2011), was installed as part of the Oct. 2010 [Adjunct+1](http://carrollgallery.tulane.edu/_adjunct_plus_one.htm) show at Tulane University's [Carroll Gallery](http://carrollgallery.tulane.edu/), and appears in my collection, [AFEELD](http://afeeld.com/).
