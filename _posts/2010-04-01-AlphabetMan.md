*Alphabet Man* (2010) is a narrative sequence of twelve concrete poems. Each poem was composed using every letter of the alphabet once and only once. Letters were not altered in any way during composition. Alphabet Man was published as a chapbook by Slack Buddha Press in April 2010, and appears as a chapter in my collection, AFEELD. Selections from *Alphabet Man* were honored with an &Now Award for Innovative Writing in 2012.

You can view the chapbook as [part of *AFEELD*](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitaloriginals/afeeld/project/alphabet-man/).
