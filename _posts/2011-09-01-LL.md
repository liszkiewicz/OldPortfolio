*LL* (2011) is a sequence of sixteen epigrams inspired by my cross-country move to Los Angeles, CA. Each epigram is displayed alongside a pair of large L's, and each takes the "LL" digraph as its subject. LL was published as a chapbook in July 2013 by [Scharmel Iris Press](http://scharmeliris.wordpress.com/books/a-j-patrick-liszkiewicz/).
