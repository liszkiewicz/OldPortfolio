*Robot Butler* (2011) is an experimental combination of time management and classic tower defense mechanics. Players find themselves in the midst of a revolution led by obsolete domestic robots, and must defend their owners' homes from relentless robotic revolutionaries while continuing to complete household chores. Inspired by the play, ["Rossum's Universal Robots"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R.), the game was created by [RUST LTD.](http://rustltd.com/)

*Robot Butler* has been exhibited at the 2013 Computers and Writing Conference, the 2013 Midwest Interdisciplinary Graduate Conference, and the "Strange Tales" exhibition at Clemson University, and is free to play on the [Kongregate website](http://www.kongregate.com/games/RUSTLTD/robot-butler). I was a designer, worldbuilder, and writer for the project.
