*Flashes* (3 min., 2007) is a short experiment in poetic, collaborative documentary. It is also the prelude to *Blue Line to Wonderland*, a limited-edition artistsâ€™ book of mixed-media poetry co-authored with Virginia M. Heatter. We screened and read our work on 21 November 2008, as part of (co)ludere III at Rust Belt Books in Buffalo, NY. I directed and edited the film, and composed and performed its music.

Thanks to Ian Adelstein, who was a production assistant for this film.
