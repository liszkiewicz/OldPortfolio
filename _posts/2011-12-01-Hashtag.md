*hashTag* (2011) is a puzzle platformer and experimental data visualization, inspired by the classic arcade game Q*bert and the Occupy Movement, in which the user advances through levels by tagging spaces while avoiding enemy peppers and dodo birds. Game levels are generated by Twitter data from a specific date and place of occupation.

*hashTag* was prototyped with [Luke Noonan](http://lukenoonan.com/) from 9-11 December 2011, as part of the USC #OccupyData Hackathon. The game has appeared in articles in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/1800700/peoples-skype-and-occupy-wall-street-hackathons) and other publications.
