*Bullet Hell* (2011) is a side-scrolling platform game in which the user controls the movement of a bullet. As with games like Canabalt and Robot Unicorn Attack, the object of the game is to prolong gameplay by avoiding collisions with the surrounding environment, and as gameplay progresses the game stage moves faster. The game explores the artistic potential of this popular game genre by removing its familiar feedback mechanisms (i.e. score, lives, music, interface), and foregrounding its eternal recurrence and limited control-set within a hellish context.

Developed with Anton Hand, *Bullet Hell* was published in [Issue 21](http://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/bullet-hell/) of *Invisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture*. It was also selected for the [Games and Art](https://web.archive.org/web/20120625234742/http://glsconference.org/2012/art.html) juried exhibition at the 2012 Games+Learning+Society Conference, the [Digital.LA](http://www.lacda.com/exhibits/NewMediaFestival.html) juried exhibition at the Los Angeles Center for Digital Art, and [CODE: A Media, Art, & Games Conference](http://code2012.wikidot.com/) at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. *Bullet Hell* has also been presented at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco, the [Transcriptions Research Slam](http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/transcriptions-presents-the-5th-annual-research-slam/) at UC Santa Barbara, and elsewhere.
