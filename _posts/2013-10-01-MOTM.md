*Museum of the Microstar* (2013) is a satirical narrative game and technology demonstration created by [RUST LTD](http://rustltd.com/). The game takes place in an underground museum built by Hedron, the last corporation in the known universe. This corporate museum chronicles (and celebrates) an historical-fictional progression of human energy technologies, which ultimately destroyed the planet Earth and all life on its surface. In this way, the game is not just a cautionary tale of ecological disaster; it is also a technology demonstration that satirizes technology demonstrations.

Museum of the Microstar was originally developed in five weeks for [the Unity DirectX11 Competition](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/02/01/directx-11-competition/), and was awarded the grand prize in February 2013. Then, it was ported to the original Oculus Rift "Development Kit 1" (DK1), and was the third published game to function on the VR device. It has been exhibited at the [GLOBALE: Global Games Exhibition](http://zkm.de/en/event/2015/08/globale-global-games) at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Karlsruhe, Germany, the ACM Siggraph ["Aesthetics of Gameplay"](http://gameartshow.siggraph.org/gas/museum-microstar/) exhibition, the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, the 2013 Game Developers' Conference, the 2013 Games+Learning+Society Conference, and elsewhere. The RUST LTD. team gave a postmortem talk about the game at [the 2013 UNITE Unity3D Developers' Conference](https://youtu.be/8iVOf4RE8N0).

The game is available as a free download from [the RUST LTD. Alloy product showcase](https://alloy.rustltd.com/showcase/museum-microstar). I was a level designer, narrative designer, worldbuilder, and writer on the project.
