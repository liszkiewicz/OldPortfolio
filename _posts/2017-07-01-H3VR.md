*Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades* (2016-present), a.k.a *H3VR*, is a virtual reality sandbox game designed for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. There are currently almost 20 different game modes, and many fans have logged over 100 hours of gameplay. Though the game is still in 'Early Access' [on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/), it has nevertheless been one of the best-selling titles for the HTC Vive since the VR platform's public release in April 2016. 

Development began through a series of technical experiments in February 2016, most of which explored realistic physics simulation. When [one of the game's development videos](https://youtu.be/zPKUO1yKAqY) (i.e. 'devlogs') went viral in March 2016, we at RUST LTD. took this as a sign that these realistic experiments were interesting to fans. From the [IMFDB](http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Hot_Dogs,_Horseshoes_%26_Hand_Grenades): "players can manipulate individual rounds in a magazine, pull the cocking lever, flip safeties, deploy a bipod, fold or collapse the stock, dry-fire, and even adjust the zeroing on sights and scopes." This focus on realistic physical affordances has led fans and critics alike to recognize the seriousness with which we treat firearms in *H3VR*. As Ben Kuchera of Polygon [wrote](https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/12/11413572/guns-virtual-reality-htc-vive), "[H3VR] proves how powerful a medium virtual reality can be for encountering something that may make you uncomfortable in real life in a way that's completely safe." The dev team continues to communicate with fans on a weekly basis, through [weekly devlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-1Z0BgpRkc&list=PLCq9IRiKLeTSpSpx_s9XZGcNc1VFO3S7n), [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/), and the [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/450540).

While the simulation behind *H3VR*'s firearms is hyper-realistic, the game excludes 'realistic' representations of human violence. As the sidebar of [the *H3VR* subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/H3VR/) states, "H3VR is a game specifically made to simulate the behavior of firearms with sport shooting and the general fascination with guns in mind. The developers do not intend to give the player an incentive to shoot humans, which is why H3VR will not feature any kind of human targets." Instead, the content of *H3VR* is satirical, parodical, darkly comedic, and often explicitly absurdist in its goals and intent.

Development of [*Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades*](http://h3vr.com/) is ongoing, and the full game will likely be released in Summer 2018. I am a designer, voice actor, worldbuilder, and writer for the game.
