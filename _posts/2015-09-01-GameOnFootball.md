*Game On Football* (2015) is a fantasy football mobile app, and digital quick play card game, in which players compete in real time at Dave & Buster’s locations. The app uses a draft process inspired by ‘five-card draw’ poker, allowing for a unique, fast, and tactical drafting experience. Players score points using standard fantasy football rules and compete in short timed rounds at Dave & Buster’s.

As the project's lead designer, I conceptualized and designed the core gameplay, wrote the game design document, and managed a five-person design team as we created, playtested, and iterated the game's prototype. I then helped direct a third-party development team as they brought the prototype to Alpha, Beta, and Gold Master. The game was published and released during the 2015 NFL Season, and played at Dave & Buster’s locations nationwide.
