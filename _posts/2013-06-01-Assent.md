*Assent* is an immersive 3d platformer about progress, where the player navigates a very dark environment built entirely of staircases. The only light sources are falling stars that bounce down the staircases, and knock you off if you are not careful to avoid them. In other words, the thing that allows you to progress is the same thing that halts your progress. Assent* tries to leverage that core tension to examine the concept of progress in an historical context.

[The original demo](https://youtu.be/q5KaTbeH8tI) was developed from October 2012 to January 2013. It was exhibited at [Repercussions: A Serious Games and Immersive Journalism Exhibit](https://vimeo.com/53633834), alongside the work of Karl Baumann and Nonny de la Pe√±a. Iteration and development continued until June 2013, when the project was shelved due to technological limitations. (I hope to revisit it someday.) I am the game director, designer, and writer for the project.
