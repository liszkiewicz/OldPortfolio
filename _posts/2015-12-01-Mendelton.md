*Mendelton* (2015) is a surrealist first person point-and-click adventure game. It begins with the player arriving via bus at the edge of a town called Mendelton, in the idle of an endless desert night. As the player begins walking toward the town down a long dark road, street lights begin turning on one by one, as if for the player alone. In this way, *Mendelton* reveals itself as a mysterious place, with strange and unsettling properties. The player proceeds toward the town and its welcome center, and the game unfolds.

The original demo was created in late 2015, as an exploration of the aesthetics of surrealist narrative in contemporary video game design. Design and development is scheduled to resume in 2018. I am the game director, designer, and writer for the project.
